# tkinter_app
Tkinter app that uses PyTorch to classify whether an image has malaria or not

Used OpenCV to read in the image and PIL library to format the image

PyTorch was used to transform images and get them ready to pass through my PyTorch model

I output whether or not the model believes malaria is present in the image, as well as the confidence it has
